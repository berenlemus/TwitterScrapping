# Twitter Scraper

This Python script is designed to scrape tweets from specific users within a given date range using the Tweepy library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Tweepy library (`pip install tweepy`)

You'll also need to have Twitter API credentials. You can obtain these by creating a Twitter Developer account and creating an application to generate API keys and access tokens.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `twitter_scraper.py` file.

2. Replace the placeholders in the script (`CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) with your actual Twitter API credentials.

3. Customize the script to specify the users you want to scrape and the date range of tweets you're interested in.

4. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python twitter_scraper.py
